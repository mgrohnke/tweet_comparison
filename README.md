This project creates an app via Flask which predicts which of two given Twitter users is more likely to have tweeted a given input text. 

  Tweet information is gathered from the Twitter API and stored in a SQLite database.  

  Spacy is then utilized for the natural language processing, and sklearn LogisticRegression is used for the prediction.
  
  Heroku is used for the public deployment.
